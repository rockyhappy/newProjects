Philosophy for life: One day without laughter is a day wasted.
Strengths: I see failure as a way to improve. Sometimes our views about success and failure are tied on what other people think about us or judge us. According to me staying positive is the best way to overcome failure.
Weakness: My tendency to take too much responsibility and discomfort about delegating task is my biggest weakness.
Hobbies: My hobbies include acting, script writing, dancing, surfing the net for knowledge, learning, Netflix and chill.
